Notes for second draft:

The stone of resurrection is related to the pillar somehow.

Dungeon is a Noahs Ark situation. But is a bunker instead of a ship

Dungeon is broken, because engine bit is heating at the very bottom. Dungeon gets slowly more broken the farther you get down.

The stone of resurrection was a failed attempt to repair the pillar/dungeon

Level Three alteration: Cryogenic/Necromancy, player can figure out that magic is just tech, characters think all technology is magic, through narrative and not design. The pillar is the thing manipulating the skeleton as a security guard. The guard is attacking because it tries to kill bandits, but is broken and tries to kill everybody, it was deactivated.

The dungeon has magical relays that go into the holy monarch kingdom, the void occultists have their own relay, but their community is more remote and smaller than the holy kingdom. This is how magic presents itself in the outside world because it all comes from the source of magic which is the dungeon/bunker/arc.


Al Thymer was captured by the general in level 5. Quest to rescue him? Really just more narrative quests on each level

Make the general more recurring



New Characters:
The Alchemist(the final floor)
The alchemist made the stone and the dungeon. basically just a software engineer, but with magical context. Holy force imposed ideas of how to build dungeon, was like OH SHIT i can save the world, everyone thinks hes crazy until the world starts ending. Just crazy drug doing engineer type. Think intp in mbti

The Priest(First floor)
His name is Al Thymer. A very old and forgetful priest(has alzheimers) Was fired by the Holy Monarch because he was too old. Is suggested that he is very powerful. Explains things about dungeon and helps The Vanguard recover. 

New magical items:

Item that helps you rez yourself: an item thats being handed out like candy by al thymer. It returns you to your save state in the last hub you were in. There are pillars that are effectively checkpoints that are related to these items that update your save state stone.
