# Getting Started - GitKraken

## Setting up GitKraken and the repository

Start by [downloading GitKraken]([https://www.gitkraken.com/](https://www.gitkraken.com/ "https://www.gitkraken.com/")) and following their setup. You will be asked to sign in with a GitKraken account, click in the sign in button and use GitHub as your account.

> [!WARNING] Note
> Make sure that the email used in Github is the same as the one used to invite you.  If you are unsure, ask Spyro.

Once you have signed in, you will be asked to either *open a repository* or *clone a repository*. Click on the *clone a repository*. It should open up a modal window.

> Simply, click on the *Clone a Repo* button. It will open the same window as seen above.

 
In said modal window, choose *Github.com*, it should change the main contents of the modal window. Then, select the repository *LabyrinthOfTheAbyss* as well as a directory for the project to be downloaded:

> In the case that you get a warning that requires you to log into Github. Go to *File > Preferences... > Integrations*. The first option should be *Github*. Sign in using the Github account that was invited into the project.

> Once you are done, exit the above menu and retry the above steps. 
 
Once you have done the above, click *Clone the repo!* If done correctly, you should be seeing something similar to the below example, with a little progress window showing the download progress:

I strongly suggest that you watch this [tutorial on how to use the UI of the program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBlijN29gb8&list=PLe6EXFvnTV78WqGmGSq8JPnafR3lAa55n) in the case that you do not know how version control works.
