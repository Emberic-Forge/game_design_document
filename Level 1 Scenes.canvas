It’s not magical but subtly enhanced to blend into the environment. Al might mutter cryptically:\n    \n    - “Oh, that? They leave things sometimes… shadows do. No, wait. _People_, yes. People hiding in shadows.”\n    - He warns Cazarus not to linger where shadows gather too long.\n2. **A Phantom Ally**: While exploring the forest’s glowing, twisted paths, Cazarus notices a figure—cloaked in shimmering fabric—darting between the glowing roots and trees. The figure doesn’t attack but instead leaves behind:\n    \n    - **A cryptic map**: It marks hidden paths or traps within the forest. The map is unsigned, but its craftsmanship suggests a keen intellect.\n    - **A concealed note**: \"Trust only the unseen.\"\n3. **Ambush Event**: Shortly after finding the note, Cazarus is ambushed by mutated beasts. A Mirage Cloak (unnamed) appears mid-battle, using trickery and illusions to disorient the creatures, helping Cazarus win.
