### **The Luminary Archive

The **Luminary Archive** is a settlement faction that stands as a beacon of loyalty to the old leadership of **Aurelia**, the once-great kingdom now known as the **Sanctum Imperium**. Nestled on the edge of a mysterious and ancient dungeon, the Luminary Archive is a haven for scholars, engineers, and adventurers who seek to uncover the secrets of the past and preserve the legacy of Aurelia. They are driven by a deep reverence for the old kingdom's values, a thirst for knowledge, and a commitment to scientific exploration.

The faction takes its name from the **Luminary Archives**, a vast repository of knowledge and artifacts recovered from the dungeon. These archives are not just a collection of books and relics; they are a testament to the faction's belief that the dungeon holds the key to restoring Aurelia's former glory. To the members of the Luminary Archive, the dungeon is both a challenge and a promise—a place where the past and the future converge.
