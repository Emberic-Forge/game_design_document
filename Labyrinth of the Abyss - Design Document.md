## Introduction

### Game Summary

Labyrinth of the Abyss is a third person dungeon crawling game about exploring an extensive labyrinth of multiple shifting layers with the goal of conquering the entirety of the labyrinth.

### Inspiration
Here are some of our gameplay and thematic inspirations for our game.
#### Elden Ring
Elden Ring’s character movement and combat provides an excellent way to interface the player’s actions with the environment and non-player characters, as the movement and combat allows for more in-depth skill expression from the players, resulting in intense and satisfying moments. Furthermore, it also allows the player itself to have their own internal progression as the player learns the flow of the movement and combat the more they play.

#### Ratchet and Clank

Ratchet and Clank’s creative arsenal of weapons allow for unlimited options of power to share to the player. From a ray gun that turns enemies into sheep to a robotic glove that throws an army of angry baby robots ready to commit war crimes, this style of power allows for more interesting variations of weapons for combat, which allows us to create some really wacky and funny effects and items.

#### Dungeons and Dragons

Character Stats in Dungeons and Dragons allow the user to determine what they can or cannot do in a given scenario as well as allows them to use certain skills and/or effects. As an example, the player would be able to open certain doors and chests given enough strength was accumulated during their playthrough. This aspect is a key inspiration to our game, since it allows us to determine the player’s progression throughout the game as well as grant the player a reward for their choices depending on what stats they invest in.

#### Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End

Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End is our core inspiration for the mood, visual theme and lore of our game, as the series is based in a very basic fantasy world consisting of elves, dwarfs, humans and demons. The labyrinth specifically has taken inspiration from the series show in Episode 23, where the main cast is tasked with conquering a really hard labyrinth. The visual theme is stylized and mid-poly to mimic the visuals of Frieren but with some darker tones to add some grittiness to the theme.

#### Made in Abyss

In Made in Abyss, the main cast is tasked with descending down a massive hole full of different environments, hostile and/or otherwise, with the biggest drawback being that people won't be able to ascend back to the surface after a certain threshold has been reached. This element of descending down to the point of no return while the environment changes is also an inspiration to how the labyrinth works in our game, as each floor will encapsulate different kinds of environments for players to explore.

### Player Experience
The player starts by selecting a character of their choice from a collection of characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and playstyles. They are then able to explore a hub world where they can upgrade each of these characters from resources gained from their exploration attempts in the labyrinth by interacting with NPCs scattered throughout the hub world. The player can also start an exploration attempt, where they are tasked with finding their way to the lower floor. As they are exploring, they find resources that they can use to further better themselves throughout the current and future runs. They also find a variety of obstacles of different difficulties that halt the player’s progression from further exploration. 

### Platform
The game is developed to be released on Windows PC
### Development Software
- Godot 4.4
- Visual Studio Code
- Mixamo for prototype character models and animations
- FMOD for dynamic audio integration

### Genre

## Target Audience

Given the depth of the combat, exploration and progression, this game’s core market leans towards the hardcore players that are able to invest their time to learn, explore and conquer the game, with the hopes that more casual players would find this game’s experience enticing.

## Lore

### Factions

There are 4 factions that represent the various NPCs and enemies in which the player will encounter.

#### [[The Luminary Archive]]

> The **Luminary Archive** is a settlement faction that stands as a beacon of loyalty to the old leadership of **Aurelia**, the once-great kingdom now known as the **Sanctum Imperium**. Nestled on the edge of a mysterious and ancient dungeon, the Luminary Archive is a haven for scholars, engineers, and adventurers who seek to uncover the secrets of the past and preserve the legacy of Aurelia. They are driven by a deep reverence for the old kingdom's values, a thirst for knowledge, and a commitment to scientific exploration.
>
> The faction takes its name from the **Luminary Archives**, a vast repository of knowledge and artifacts recovered from the dungeon. These archives are not just a collection of books and relics; they are a testament to the faction's belief that the dungeon holds the key to restoring Aurelia's former glory. To the members of the Luminary Archive, the dungeon is both a challenge and a promise—a place where the past and the future converge.

This faction is where the mc will spend most of his time with as several NPCs come from this faction to assist the mc.

#### [[The Sanctum Imperium - Aurelia]]

> The **The Sanctum Imperium: Aurelia** is a powerful and deeply religious faction in a vast, magical world shrouded in mystery. This world, though devoid of gods, is teeming with arcane energies and ancient secrets. The inhabitants, while aware of the magical forces around them, do not fully understand the extent of their world. Some believe in higher powers manipulating events from the shadows, while others attribute the world's wonders to the natural order. Amidst this uncertainty, Aurelia stands as a beacon of faith, order, and divine purpose—or so they claim.

This faction is the main antagonistic faction against the mc as several characters from this faction are at odds with the mc.

#### [[The Crimson Coin]]

> The **Crimson Coin** is a sprawling underground network that thrives in the shadows of the Holy Monarch Kingdom and beyond. Unlike the rigid hierarchy and religious fervor of the Holy Monarchs, the Crimson Coin is a chaotic, lawless organization built on greed, ambition, and survival. It is a haven for mercenaries, thieves, assassins, and crime lords, all united by their pursuit of wealth and power. The Crimson Coin operates as a parallel world, hidden from the eyes of the righteous, where gold and blood are the only currencies that matter.
> 
> The faction takes its name from the **Crimson Coin**, a symbolic token used to represent membership and influence within the organization. The coin is said to be stained with the blood of its first bearer, a legendary thief who founded the faction centuries ago. To hold a Crimson Coin is to hold power—but it is also a target on one's back.

This faction acts like a black market of sorts in-game, allowing for more challenging and reward quests to exist. 
#### [[The Abyssal Choir]]

> The **Abyssal Choir** is a dark and enigmatic faction that stands in stark contrast to the radiant and orderly **Aurelia** (formerly the Holy Monarch Kingdom). Where Aurelia is guided by light, faith, and divine purpose, the Abyssal Choir is driven by shadow, forbidden knowledge, and an insatiable hunger for power. They are the outcasts, the banished, and the damned—those who have been cast aside by Aurelia for their atrocities and heretical pursuits. Yet, in their exile, they have found a new purpose: to unravel the mysteries of the void and harness its limitless potential, no matter the cost.
>
> The Abyssal Choir is not merely a faction; it is a symphony of despair, ambition, and transformation. Their name comes from the haunting, otherworldly chants that echo through their rituals, as if the void itself is singing through them. To hear the Choir is to hear the whispers of the abyss—a sound that chills the soul and bends the mind.

This faction is used to explain some of the more powerful weapons and enemies to exist.

| ### **Elvaris - Enemy Outline**<br><br>**Role:** Final Boss of Level 1  <br>**Faction:** Holy Zealots  <br>**Title:** Commander of the Search Party  <br>**Theme:** Tragic Betrayal and Fanatical Devotion  <br>**Description:** Elvaris was once a trusted lieutenant under Cazarus, known for his strict discipline and tactical prowess. Following Cazarus’ fall from grace, Elvaris was persuaded (or coerced) by Cardinal Varestin to lead the search party tasked with capturing or killing Cazarus and his family. His blind loyalty to the Monarch Kingdom and its divine mandate leads him down a dark path, ultimately becoming a symbol of the tragic cost of zealotry.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Visual Design**<br><br>- **Appearance:**<br>    <br>    - Tall, with a commanding presence enhanced by his ornate Holy Vanguard armor.<br>    - His plate mail is golden, but streaked with blood and soot, symbolizing his moral corruption.<br>    - Wields a massive halberd imbued with faint holy light, cracked and unstable due to the forest’s corrupted magic.<br>    - His face is partially obscured by a helmet, with weary, haunted eyes visible through the visor.<br>- **Environment:**<br>    <br>    - The fight takes place in a **sacred grove**, now warped by the dungeon’s breaking magic. The area features glowing roots, unstable terrain, and creeping darkness that grows as the battle progresses.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Combat Design**<br><br>#### **Phase 1: Commanding Precision**<br><br>- **Behavior:**<br>    - Elvaris fights methodically, issuing commands to a small squad of Zealot soldiers (adds). He coordinates their attacks, creating pressure on the player.<br>    - **Abilities:**<br>        - **Tactical Sweep:** A wide halberd swing that forces players to dodge or risk knockback.<br>        - **Holy Rally:** Temporarily buffs the Zealot adds, increasing their damage and speed.<br>        - **Shield Wall:** Summons spectral shields to block ranged attacks.<br><br>#### **Phase 2: Desperation and Corruption**<br><br>- **Trigger:** At 50% health, the corrupted magic of the forest begins to affect Elvaris. His movements become erratic, and his attacks more brutal but less controlled.<br>- **Abilities:**<br>    - **Fractured Strike:** Slams the halberd into the ground, creating a shockwave that disrupts the terrain and sends fragments flying.<br>    - **Corrupted Smite:** Channels unstable energy into the halberd, unleashing an explosive attack that damages himself as well as the player.<br>    - **Wrath of the Fallen:** Summons spectral apparitions of his fallen comrades to attack the player, emphasizing his guilt and torment.<br><br>#### **Phase 3: The Broken Loyalist**<br><br>- **Trigger:** At 25% health, Elvaris is fully consumed by the corruption, his armor and halberd glowing faintly with cracks of unstable magic. He moves with reckless abandon, driven by desperation.<br>- **Abilities:**<br>    - **Frenzied Assault:** Rapid, unpredictable melee combos with minimal cooldowns.<br>    - **Corrupting Aura:** Emits an aura that drains stamina or magic over time, forcing the player to stay mobile.<br>    - **Final Stand:** At critical health, Elvaris becomes temporarily invulnerable, charging a devastating attack that must be interrupted or avoided. | ### **Loot and Rewards**<br><br>1. **Halberd of Fallen Faith:** A unique weapon that deals extra damage to Zealots but carries a chance to inflict a minor stamina drain on the user.<br>2. **Fragmented Vanguard Sigil:** Can be sold or used in crafting, foreshadowing its connection to higher-level Holy Vanguard artifacts.<br>3. **Journal Fragment:** A torn piece of Elvaris’ journal hinting at Varestin’s manipulations and his regret over following orders. |

## Concept

### Basic Mechanics

The player controls their character in a third-person perspective, with movement and combat tailored to the class they choose. The key mechanics of movement, interactivity, and combat include:

- Movement:
	- The player can move in all directions using standard third-person controls, with movement speed and agility varying by class.
	- Jumping: Certain classes, such as the Rogue, can jump higher or with greater frequency, while heavier classes like the Vanguard may have limited jumping ability due to their armor.
	- Dodge Rolling: Agile classes such as the Rogue can perform dodge rolls to evade attacks or move quickly, while heavier classes may have slower dodge rolls but more defensive options like shield blocking.
	- Crouching: Agile classes can crouch faster and can use crouch to enable class specific effects, such as enabling stealth for the Rogue.
- Combat:
	- Attack: The player can perform attacks based on the weapon they are currently using. Each weapon has unique animations, attack speeds, and effects (e.g., slashing with a sword, firing a bow, casting a spell).
	- Weapon Switching: Depending on the class, the player can carry a set number of weapons at once (e.g., dual-wielding daggers or switching between a staff and a wand for the Elementalist). Weapons can be swapped mid-combat to adjust to different situations.
	- Combos and Power Attacks: Certain classes and weapons allow for combo chains or powerful charged attacks, which can deal more damage but require precise timing or positioning.
- Environmental Interactivity:
	- The player can interact with their environment in various ways, such as opening chests, activating traps, or unlocking doors. Some classes, like the Engineer, may be able to disarm traps or hack mechanical devices, while others rely on brute force.
	- Environmental hazards like collapsing terrain or moving platforms require precise movement or quick reactions.
	- Some biomes also feature destructible environments, allowing the player to create new paths or collapse obstacles on enemies.


  

### Character Stats

There are 3 primary stats in the game. Each stat will allow the player to have different game loops depending on the stat amount:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Strength<br><br>Increases melee damage and health.|If invested, allows the player to break certain elements in the world as well as allowing the player to withstand greater forms of damage depending on the strength amount.|
|Intelligence<br><br>Increases spell damage and spell cast speed.|If invested, allows the player to interact with elements that the player would normally not be able to.|
|Dexterity<br><br>Increases attack speed and evasion.|If invested, allows the player to use advanced movement abilities for terrain manoeuvrability.|

Accessory items and/or item sets will grant the player additional value to the 3 above stats when equipped. Other items may have a required amount of stats in order to be equipped.

### Items

When exploring the dungeon, the player can encounter points of interest that contain items that can aid the player. These items usually are materials that the player can either sell for gold or use to craft a variety of weapons, utility items and passive items.

There are 4 types of items:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Weapons<br><br>Allows the user to execute a variety of attacks. Stats Requirement.|Weapon items may be equipped with additional but limited functionality <br><br>  <br><br>Additionally, the player can access several advanced attack moves depending on the level mastery of a weapon type. <br><br>  <br><br>The player can get mastery experience simply by using a weapon attack on an enemy.|
|Utility<br><br>Contains a non-damaging effect that the user can use. Stats Requirement.|Utility items usually have unlimited usages, but have some form of limitation. An example would be a grapple hook.|
|Armor<br><br>Primary defence layer, granting health, damage reduction and evasion effects. Stats Requirement.|Armor items can belong to a set, granting additional effects should the user have all armor items of a set equipped.|
|Accessory<br><br>Passive items that grant passive stats. No Stats Requirement.|Some accessory items may contain an additional effect in conjunction to their stat bonuses.|

These items have a rarity associated with them, indicating how common they are to find and their value in gold.

The rarity is as follows:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Common<br><br>This rarity describes items that don't have any special property besides their base design and, as the name suggests, are common to find.|This includes basic swords, bows and other contraptions that exist in the real world.|
|Uncommon<br><br>This rarity describes items that do have some form of a special property in conjunction with their base design but the effect is minor.|This includes items comprised of weak materials being reinforced with magic or the item itself is a conduit to activate a magical effect|
|Rare<br><br>This rarity describes items that have more major special properties that are an addition to their base design.|This includes items that contain special effects within them and that allow the user to activate special effects and moves, like a flame sword attack.|
|Epic<br><br>Similar to Rare, but has the addition of more powerful items in both innate design and effect|This includes items that have powerful effects with minimal drawbacks or items that are built to the utmost limit of their design.|
|Unique<br><br>This rarity describes items that have characteristics only special to the item. These items are extremely hard to craft/get due to their rarity but their innate effects are the best in the game.|This includes items that belong to a major character or area or to a particularly rare material that describes the item's characteristics or insane effects.|

The rarity of items increases the further the player explores the dungeon, allowing for natural progression to occur.

### Hub World

The hub world itself can evolve as the player progresses, unlocking new areas, NPCs, and secrets. Some upgrades might even alter the labyrinth’s layout, offering shortcuts or revealing hidden paths. For instance:

- The Blacksmith: Enhances weapons, armor, and tools, allowing players to improve damage, defense, or utility. Allows unlocking of the Engineer Class
- The Scholar: Offers magical upgrades or insight into the lore of the labyrinth, unlocking new magical gadgets or passive bonuses. Allows unlocking of the Elementalist Class
- The Explorer's Guild: Offers maps and detailed information on the labyrinth's dangers. Allows unlocking of the Mystic Class
- The Tavern: Offers a Job Board, can buy alcohol, or find a place to sleep. Allows unlocking of the Rogue Class

The hub world starts with The Tavern next to the entrance of the labyrinth and the player can contribute to expanding the hub world by paying to build the above buildings.

### Classes and Playstyles

There are 4 different characters that the player can choose from, each with proficiencies in a specific stat line. These characters represent the different playstyles that players can choose from, allowing for variety in gameplay loops.

|                                                                                                                  |     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Character - Code Name: Warrior<br><br>Core Characteristics: Proficiency in Strength, Melee Oriented              |     |
| Character - Code Name: Rogue<br><br>Core Characteristics: Proficiency in Dexterity, Melee Oriented               |     |
| Character - Code Name: Mage<br><br>Core Characteristics: Proficiency in Intelligence and Spells, Ranged Oriented |     |

Any character can technically specialise in any sort of archetype given by weapons and armor sets.

### Exploration Attempt

The player area consists of 5 floors where each floor is procedurally generated. Each floor is generated to represent a biome, an area where there are naturally occurring landmasses and buildings within the floor area.

  

From start to the end, these biomes include:

- Forest Biome (Starting Floor):
	- Environment: The dense forest is filled with narrow paths, overgrown vines, and occasional wildlife. The player will need to navigate tight spaces and use natural elements such as fallen trees or dense brush to hide or traverse quickly.
	- Encounters: Enemies in this biome might use camouflage to blend into the forest, with ambush tactics being common. Some may be wildlife creatures, while others could be humanoid enemies using the terrain for surprise attacks.
	- Resources/Rewards: This biome contains hidden villages or structures that resemble small towns, where loot such as basic armor, potions, or low-tier weapons can be found. Players will also encounter environmental hazards, such as thorny undergrowth, that slow them down.
- Desert Biome (Second Floor):
	- Environment: Vast open dunes, with frequent sandstorms that limit visibility and accuracy, making long-range combat more challenging. The arid conditions may also drain the player's stamina more quickly, simulating heat exhaustion.
	- Encounters: Enemies here may use the open terrain to engage in long-range combat, such as archers or magic users that thrive in large spaces. Some might burrow underground or hide beneath the sands, emerging to ambush the player.
	- Resources/Rewards: Ancient ruins dot the landscape, filled with traps like collapsing floors or dart-shooting walls. These ruins house valuable loot, such as rare gems, powerful weapons, or magical artifacts. The player will need to avoid environmental hazards such as quicksand or heat-related effects to reach these treasures.
- Mountain Biome (Third Floor):
	- Environment: Steep cliffs and narrow, winding paths make traversal difficult, with the constant risk of falling. The player will have to deal with vertical movement, climbing up or down cliffs while avoiding environmental hazards like rock slides.
	- Encounters: Enemies in this biome may have a height advantage, with archers or ranged attackers positioned on higher ground. There might also be large, powerful beasts native to the mountain, capable of pushing the player off cliffs or destroying narrow paths.
	- Resources/Rewards: Fortified structures are built into the mountain, offering rich rewards such as advanced weapons or defensive gear. These structures are heavily guarded and filled with complex traps, like falling boulders or spike pits.
- Snowy Biome (Fourth Floor):
	- Environment: Covered in deep snow and ice, movement is slowed, and players will face the risk of freezing or sliding on ice. Frequent blizzards reduce visibility and make navigation difficult, while some areas may be entirely inaccessible due to ice barriers.
	- Encounters: Enemies in this biome are adapted to the cold, possibly resistant to ice-based attacks. Some enemies may hide within snowdrifts, using the poor visibility to their advantage. There may also be environmental hazards like sudden avalanches.
	- Resources/Rewards: Hidden within icy caves or snow-covered ruins are rare materials like enchanted ice crystals or cold-resistant armor. The player might also find magical items that grant temporary immunity to freezing effects.
- Volcanic Biome (Last Floor):
	- Environment: The terrain is constantly shifting due to lava flows and volcanic eruptions. The player will have to avoid environmental dangers like falling rocks, geysers of steam, or rivers of molten lava, which deal significant damage if touched.
	- Encounters: Fire-based enemies dominate this biome, including lava beasts and fire elementals that are immune to heat-based attacks. These enemies might use the environment to their advantage, hiding in lava pools or using fire-based ranged attacks.
	- Resources/Rewards: Deep within the volcanic caverns, players will find powerful, heat-resistant armor or fire-based magical weapons. The lava pools may also conceal rare materials needed for crafting high-level equipment. However, the constant threat of collapsing terrain makes exploration dangerous.

Each biome also contains a central massive glowing pillar landmark, and players have a limited time (30 minutes) to find an exit to descend to the next floor. If they fail to escape before the timer expires, the entire floor shifts, resulting in the player's death. The exit is sometimes guarded by a boss and it is up to the player to figure out how to go past said enemy.

Between each floor, there are intermediate floors where the floor never shifts, as indicated by the lack of glow from the central massive pillar. As such, adventurers have created a settlement where the player can sell their findings and buy useful items for gold.

At the last floor, the player always encounters a boss  that they have to defeat. In doing so, they are rewarded with loot and their exploration attempt ends.
